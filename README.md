RETINAL OCT IMAGE SEGEMENTATION

INTRODUCTION

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that has revolutionized the field of ophthalmology, particularly in the assessment and diagnosis of various retinal conditions. Retinal OCT imaging provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina, allowing clinicians to visualize and analyze the different layers of the retina in detail.
The primary objective of retinal OCT imaging is to non-invasively visualize and analyze the microstructure of the retina with high resolution. 

CONTEXT

Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).

(Far left) Choroidal Neo-Vascularization (CNV) with neovascular membrane (white arrowheads) and associated subretinal fluid (arrows). (Middle left) Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) with retinal-thickening-associated intraretinal fluid (arrows). (Middle right) Multiple drusen (arrowheads) present in early AMD. (Far right) Normal retina with preserved foveal contour and absence of any retinal fluid/edema.

DATASET

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN). There are 84,495 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 4 categories (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN).
Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.
